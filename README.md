## Customer Tracker

#### Installation

After cloning this repository:

```
cd customer-tracker
npm install
```

#### Running the app

Open the project directory in two tabs. Run the first command in the first tab and the second command in the second tab. The application will now be running and backed by a JSON server.

```js
npm run json-api // start & watch json-server on port 4200
npm run start // start the application
```

#### Next Steps

Here's a list of features I might add if I continued working on the App

- A form validation service
- Extract API calls into a sperate file
- Add search functionality to filter customer list
- Add images to customers
- More robust error handling
